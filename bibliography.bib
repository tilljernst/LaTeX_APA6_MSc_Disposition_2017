abstract = {Personal social media usage is pervasive in both personal and professional lives. Practitioner articles and news stories have commented on the addicting and distracting nature of social media. Previous empirical research has established the negative effects of distractions on primary tasks. To date, little research has looked at the potentially distracting nature of social media and the negative effects that can arise from usage. This research addresses this gap by investigating the effects of personal social media usage on task performance. To extend this research, I also examined the effects that the personal social media usage has on individuals' technostress and happiness levels. I tested these effects by creating a classroom task environment and measuring subjects' usage of social media and their task performance. From this, it was found that higher amounts of personal social media usage led to lower performance on the task, as well as higher levels of technostress and lower happiness. These results are consistent across different levels of attentional control and multitasking computer self-efficacy. These results suggest that the personal usage of social media during professional (vs. personal or play) times can lead to negative consequences and is worthy of further study.},

abstract = {This editorial discusses the difference made by 'the digital' to children's experiences of risk. In Brindova et al.'s (2014) article in this issue, a large-scale correlational study sets up just the puzzle: watching television for more than 3 h per day is correlated with a host of adverse symptoms (headaches, irritability, and depression). The authors complicate the story by showing what many have suspected, namely a curvilinear relation between, in this case, amount of online communication and life satisfaction. To resolve the correlation/cause problem in a domain where one can hardly experiment with teenagers' lives, longitudinal research is helpful. The authors report that higher use of mobile phones and television viewing is associated, 1 year later, with greater levels of depression among teenagers. This seems to establish the case for media harm. But, being cautious, one should note that it is not clear whether the authors have investigated or controlled for the possible role of offline risks in teenagers' lives (classically, as a putative 'third cause' of the observed correlations).

In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, duration of media exposure at age 6 months was associated with lower cognitive development at age 14 months (unadjusted: r = -0.17, P {\textless} .01; adjusted: $\beta$ = -0.15, P = .02) and lower language development (r = -0.16, P {\textless} .01; $\beta$ = -0.16, P {\textless} .01). Of 3 types of content assessed, only 1 (older child/adult-oriented) was associated with lower cognitive and language development at age 14 months. No significant associations were seen with exposure to young child-oriented educational or noneducational content.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to have longitudinally assessed associations between media exposure in infancy and subsequent developmental outcomes in children from families with low socioeconomic status in the United States. Findings provide strong evidence in support of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations of no media exposure prior to age 2 years, although further research is needed.},

Data analysis focuses on the complex interplay between the story-book app's interactive features and the children's responses to them. Our findings show that interactive elements increase the child's autonomy, as they tend to promote the importance of the reader, positioning him or her as a collaborator, storyteller, an author or an internal character in the fiction; something that can materialise in exciting narrative strategies that can trigger powerful responses to digital literary texts in emergent readers, including playing, creating new fictions or engaging emotionally with the story. Fi-nally, we argue that the Reader Response models that have been used over recent decades to understand children's reading experiences with storybooks need to be revised to better understand their current expe-riences with interactive texts.},

abstract = {BackgroundMental stress and emotion have long been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in animal models and humans. The effect of mental challenge on ventricular action potential duration (APD) in conscious healthy humans has not been reported. Methods and ResultsActivation recovery intervals (ARI) measured from unipolar electrograms as a surrogate for APD (n=19) were recorded from right and left ventricular endocardium during steady state pacing while subjects watched an emotionally charged film clip. To assess the possible modulating role of altered respiration on APD, the subjects then repeated the same breathing pattern they had during the stress, but without the movie clip. Haemodynamic parameters (mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, and rate of pressure increase) and respiration rate increased during the stressful part of the film clip (p=0.001). APD decreased during the stressful parts of the film clip, eg for global RV ARI at end of film clip 193.8ms (SD 14) vs 198.0ms (SD13) during the matched breathing control (end film LV 199.8ms (SD16) vs control 201.6ms (SD15), p=0.004. Respiration rate increased during the stressful part of the film clip (by 2 breaths/minute), and was well matched in the respective control period without any haemodynamic or ARI changes. ConclusionsOur results document for the first time direct recordings of the effect of a mental challenge protocol on ventricular action potential duration in conscious humans. The effect of mental challenge on APD was not secondary to emotionally-induced altered respiration or heart rate.},

@phdthesis{Erasmus2014,
abstract = {Technology has been an integral part of human life since the 19th century's Industrial Revolution, and the advancement of technologies has continued into the 21st century. Of all new emerging technologies, the computer has been identified as the most important, most complex and fastest emerging technology. In order for businesses to compete and survive within the business world, they are compelled to adopt new computer technologies. However, computers alone cannot improve organisational performance. Computers need to be accepted, optimally used and utilised by employees in order for an organisation to succeed. One such technology is SAP AG's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system which is a real-time, fully integrated business system used by more than 170 000 organisations in 120 countries. Measuring information system success has been a concern since its inception due to its complexity and difficulty to appraise. Researchers traditionally attempted to measure success by the delivering of a functional information system product within certain monetary and time constraints. Subsequently, evidence suggested that a more accurate measure of success lies within the field of system use. One model of assessing and predicting user acceptance and which has gained popularity in recent years is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Apart from accepting the SAP ERP system, users should also be of the intention to continuously use it as a job requirement. The model for measuring user commitment is psychological attachment which determines whether the commitment is insincere and temporary, or long-lasting. Further, not only do users need to accept and continuously use an information technology like SAP ERP; they also need to be able to cope while using it. If not, psychological stress known as techno stress develops and prevents the optimal use of this system. With these three possible explanations for computer technology avoidance as a premise of departure, this study aims to determine the congruence, if any, between the sub-constructs of the TAM (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward using, behavioural intention to use and actual system use), psychological attachment (compliance, identification and internalisation), and techno stress (negative computer thoughts) within a South African SAP ERP user environment. A cross-sectional survey design was used rendering a convenience sample of N = 241 from among the SAP ERP user fraternity at a South African steel manufacturer. The measuring instruments used were the 23-item Technology Acceptance Questionnaire (TAM), the 10-item Psychological Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ) and the 20-item Computer Thoughts Survey (CTS-C). Study 1 which was a literature review confirmed conceptual congruence in that although the technology acceptance model was the most parsimonious, powerful and widely applied theoretical model, it was constrained due to the omission of social influence (psychological attachment) as a contributing factor in the processes of behavioural change towards technology acceptance. Furthermore, it was found that techno stress lowers employee efficiency and creates dissonance in the work environment, resulting in acceptance, hesitance or resistance towards the technology in question. Congruence was established between the system itself (technology acceptance), social relationships (psychological acceptance), and inherent psychological stress (techno stress). The aim of study 2 was to test the technology acceptance model within a South African SAP ERP user environment. Structural equation modelling confirmed that positive inter-construct relationships exist between all TAM constructs. Actual system use, which is the measurement for technology acceptance, was directly affected by behavioural intention to use and indirectly by perceived usefulness. In turn, behavioural intention to use was directly affected by perceived usefulness, attitude toward using and indirectly by perceived ease of use. Attitude toward using was directly affected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness was directly affected by perceived ease of use. Study 3 revealed that internalisation had a direct positive effect on behavioural intention to use and an indirect effect on actual system use via behavioural intention to use. Furthermore, in this study identification had direct positive effects on internalisation, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and actual system use. Indirect effects emerged between identification and behavioural intention to use via internalisation as well as behavioural intention to use via perceived usefulness. Compliance, on the other hand, had negligible, negative direct effects on all TAM constructs of which the most prominent was that on attitude toward using. Results acquired from structural equation modelling in study four confirmed that weak negative relationships existed between techno stress and all TAM constructs. This finding is contrary to other studies and can be attributed to the fact that participants in this study were at large, proficient around SAP ERP and therefore experienced low levels of techno stress. Furthermore, aspects such as effective training, clear deadlines, effective teamwork, recurrent performance evaluations, job security, career development and realistic job load are all antidotes for techno stress which is believed to be current within the participant fraternity. In a concluding chapter the conclusions derived from the literature review, as well as the empirical research were presented and recommendations flowing from this research study were made.},

abstract = {This paper offers a new characterisation of young children's (2–8 years) reading for pleasure (RfP) with digital books. This characterisation is rooted in a re-contextualisation of Anna Craft's conceptualisation of twenty-first century childhoods in Creativity and education futures (Stoke on Trent, Trentham, 2011) and a review of the literature concerning young children's RfP with digital books. The paper develops Craft's (2011) work by considering the ways in which digital books can resource the ‘4Ps of digital childhood' in reading for pleasure. Six facets of reader engagement, nested within Craft's (2011) 4Ps, are presented: affective, creative, interactive, shared, sustained and personalised reading engagements. It is argued that this characterisation of young children's reading engagements can enrich our understanding of the affordances of digital books in relation to RfP in the twenty-first century. The paper thus offers an important new contribution, going beyond established work in the field, which typically explores digital books in relation to children's learning, product design or developmental outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2015 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education},

abstract = {This study examined the literacy practices of children ages 5–11 as they engaged in out-of-school use of virtual worlds. The purpose of the study was to explore the nature, purpose, and role of literacy in children's use of a virtual world. In this article, I reflect on how children's use of literacy practices in the virtual world constructed and maintained an online social order. One hundred seventy-five children in an English primary school completed an online survey from which their use of virtual worlds was examined. Individual and group interviews were then conducted with 26 children across the year. The interviews established that children used the virtual worlds to extend contact with peers they had regular interaction with in the offline world. Further, three 11-year-old children were filmed at home as they used the virtual world Club Penguin. Additional interviews were conducted with the three children and their parents. Data analysis focused on the ways in which children drew on specific literacy practices to construct and maintain an interaction order. A key finding is that literacy operates as a means of developing online social cohesion, but the literacy practices that serve this function are located within the social, material, and cultural structures in which the children operate in the offline world and thus cannot be viewed in isolation from these wider discourses.},

abstract = {This paper tests the structure and the predictors of two psychological experiences of technostress associated with the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), i.e., technostrain (users report feelings of anxiety, fatigue, scepticism and inefficacy beliefs related to the use of technologies) and technoaddiction (users feel bad due to an excessive and compulsive use of these technologies). The study included a sample of 1072 ICT users (N = 675 nonintensive ICT users and N = 397 intensive ICT users). Results from multigroup confirmatory factor analyses among non-intensive and intensive ICT users showed, as expected, the four-factor structure of technostrain in both samples. Secondly, and also as expected, confirmatory factorial analyses revealed that technostress experiences are characterized not only by technostrain but also by an excessive and compulsive use of ICT. Moreover, multiple analyses of variance showed significant differences between non-intensive and intensive ICT users (1) in the dimensions of technostress and (2) in specific job demands and job/personal resources. Finally, linear multiple regression analyses revealed that technostrain is positively predicted by work overload, role ambiguity, emotional overload, mobbing and obstacles hindering ICT use, as well as by lack of autonomy, transformational leadership, social support, ICT use facilitators and mental competences. Work overload, role ambiguity and mobbing, as well as the lack of emotional competences, positively predict technoaddiction. Theoretical and practical implications, in addition to future research, are discussed.},

abstract = {Die JAMES-Studie 2010 erfasst das Medienverhalten von Schweizer Jugendlichen und dient damit als Wissensgrundlage die (Medien-)P{\"{a}}dagogik, die Politik im Bereich der Mediennutzung und Medienkompetenz und weiterf{\"{u}}hrende Forschung. {\"{U}}ber 1‘000 Jugendliche im Alter von 12 bis 19 Jahren wurden mittels Fragebogen im Klassenverband befragt. Die Stichprobe ist repr{\"{a}}sentativ in Bezug auf die Grundgesamtheit und l{\"{a}}sst Vergleiche zwischen Subgruppen zu. Hierbei wurde der Fokus auf Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern, zwischen vier Altersgruppen und zwischen den drei gr{\"{o}}ssten Sprachregionen der Schweiz (Deutschschweiz, Romandie und Tessin) gelegt. Ebenso wurden drei Stufen des sozialen Status, der Urbanit{\"{a}}tsgrad des Wohnortes der Befragten (st{\"{a}}dtisch oder l{\"{a}}ndlich), die Herkunft (Schweizer oder Migrationshintergrund) und bei einer Teilstichprobe, drei verschiedene Schultypen miteinander verglichen. Neben den allgemeinen Freizeitaktivit{\"{a}}ten, nonmedial und medial, wurden die Bereiche Computer und Internet, mit einem Augenmerk auf die Social Networks erhoben. Des Weiteren wurde die Nutzung von Handy und Videogames n{\"{a}}her betrachtet. Es zeigt sich, dass die Schweizer Jugendlichen eine aktive und individuelle Freizeitgestaltung pflegen, mit und ohne Medien. Mit hoher technischer Kompetenz bewegen sie sich im Internet und den Social Networks und nutzen ausgiebig diverse Funktionen des Hybridmediums Handy. Auf der Basis der differenzierten Daten lassen sich inad{\"{a}}quater Medienumgang von Heranwachsenden ermitteln und Ansatzpunkte zur Pr{\"{a}}vention ableiten. Die Schweizer Jugendlichen pflegen einen aktiven Umgang mit Medien. Dennoch zeigen die vorliegenden Daten auf, dass es keine allgemein g{\"{u}}ltige Beschreibung f{\"{u}}r das Medienverhalten des Schweizer Jugendlichen gibt. In diversen Bereichen unterscheidet sich die Mediennutzung der Heranwachsenden zum Beispel in den drei Sprachregionen stark voneinander. Vor dem Hintergrund des jeweiligen Kulturraumes sind Interpretationen nur mit Bedacht zu machen. Gr{\"{u}}nde f{\"{u}}r solche Abweichungen zu finden erfordert eine ausf{\"{u}}hrliche Untersuchung mit Fokus auf diesen Bereich. Zwischen den Geschlechtern, den Altersgruppen, etc. finden sich Differenzen, welche teilweise durch unterschiedliche Zug{\"{a}}nge oder andersartige Mediensozialisation erkl{\"{a}}rbar sind. Wichtig ist im Hinterkopf zu behalten, dass es keinen einheitlichen Umgang mit Medien gibt, wenn {\"{u}}ber Jugendliche in der Schweiz gesprochen wird. So sollte diese Vielfalt in der P{\"{a}}dagogik und auch in der Politik ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden. In ihrer Freizeit gehen die Befragten sowohl medialen, in erster Linie mit Handy und Internet, als auch nonmedialen Aktivit{\"{a}}ten intensiv nach, wie z.B. Verabredungen mit Freunden oder sportlichen Bet{\"{a}}tigungen. Das multifunktionale Mobiltelefon und der Computer sind nahezu fl{\"{a}}chendeckend in den Haushalten vorhanden und werden auch rege genutzt. Die technische Computer-Kompetenz ist hoch - insbesondere bei den Knaben – und sie steigt mit dem Alter weiter an. Die Jugendlichen wissen wie sie Computer und Internet gezielt einsetzen k{\"{o}}nnen, um sich Informationen zu beschaffen, unterhalten zu werden und Pflichten nach zu gehen f{\"{u}}r Schule und Arbeit. Insbesondere die Art der Informationsbeschaffung im Internet scheint interessanten Ver{\"{a}}nderungesprozessen unterworfen zu sein, neben den klassischen Suchmaschinen wie Google werden vermehrt auch Social Networks dazu genutzt. Dies w{\"{u}}rde die These untermauern, dass z.B. Facebook als eine spezifische Form einer «Tageszeitung» f{\"{u}}r das Geschehen im sozialen Umfeld genutzt wird. Ein grosser Teil der Befragten ist auf Social Networks vertreten, ein Vergleich mit den publizierten Nutzerzahlen8 der Plattform-Anbieter zeigt aber, dass diese Angaben mit Vorsicht zu geniessen sind. So kursiert zum Beispiel f{\"{u}}r das Jahr 2009 die Zahl von 333‘400 Schweizer Facebooknutzer in der Altergruppe 14- bis 17 Jahre. Das w{\"{a}}ren bei einer Gesamtzahl von 353‘4009 Einwohnern in dieser Altersgruppe ein Anteil von 94.3 {\%}, die {\"{u}}ber einen Facebook Account verf{\"{u}}gen. Diese Zahl ist offenbar zu hoch und wird durch Doppelaccounts oder falschen Altersangaben etc. verf{\"{a}}lscht. Mit einem Blick auf die Ergebnisse aus dem Kapitel Videogames ist zu erkennen, dass der typische Videogamer m{\"{a}}nnlich, eher j{\"{u}}nger ist und in der s{\"{u}}dlichen Schweiz wohnt. Mehr als zwei Drittel der Gamer haben schon Videogames gespielt, f{\"{u}}r die sie eigentlich zu jung waren. Hier besteht Handlungsbedarf im Hinblick auf den verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Videogames. Von Heranwachsenden im Alter von 12 Jahren ist ein solcher nicht zu erwarten, sie ben{\"{o}}tigen dazu Unterst{\"{u}}tzung ihrer erwachsenen Bezugspersonen, seien dies Eltern, Lehrer oder andere Vertrauenspersonen. Dies setzt voraus, dass diese sich auf die Welt der Videogames einlassen, und im besten Falle selbst einmal einen Controller in die Hand nehmen oder sich in ein Online-Game einloggen. An dieser Stelle sei ein Hinweis auf die PEGI-Kriterien10 erlaubt, welche sowohl Altersangaben als auch Inhaltskriterien zur Begr{\"{u}}ndung der Altersempfehlung aufweisen. «In der Schweiz haben sich die Hersteller von Games sowie der Handel freiwillig einem 'Code of Conduct' unterstellt. Dieser aktive Jugendschutz soll Alterskontrollen an den Kassen sicherstellen und sieht Werbeeinschr{\"{a}}nkungen vor. Ausserdem verpflichtet er den H{\"{a}}ndler auch dazu, nur Spiele zu verkaufen, die durch das PEGI-Rating gekennzeichnet sind» (PEGI. Pan European Game Information, 2010). Daran k{\"{o}}nnen sich sowohl Nutzerinnen und Nutzer als auch die Erziehungsverantwortlichen orientieren. Ebenfalls hilfreich sind die Hinweise der Positivpr{\"{a}}dikatisierung (siehe www.bupp.at). Als letztes sollen die Erkenntnisse zum Handy zusammengefasst werden, welches als das aktuell wichtigste Jugendmedium bezeichnet werden kann. Es wird h{\"{a}}ufig genutzt, pr{\"{a}}feriert wird dabei die SMS-Funktion, noch vor dem Telefonieren. Daneben sind eine Reihe von weiteren Funktionen wie der integrierte Musikplayer oder die Kamera beliebt bei den Jugendlichen. Problematisch wird die Handynutzung dann, wenn mit dieser Kamera z.B. Schl{\"{a}}gereien gefilmt werden oder mit Hilfe des Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) Pornofilme verschickt werden. Dieses Problem ist insbesondere unter den Knaben verbreitet, da es im Altersverlauf keine Zunahme gibt, ist es wichtig in der Pr{\"{a}}ventionsarbeit sehr fr{\"{u}}h, also um das zw{\"{o}}lfte Lebensjahr mit Aufkl{\"{a}}rung und Interventionsarbeit anzusetzen und diese auch geschlechtsspezifisch zu gestalten. Wie unterscheidet sich die Lage der Schweiz allgemein von Deutschland? Obwohl in der deutschen JIM-Studie (mpfs, 2010) mit der telefonischen Befragung eine andere Erhebungs-Methode verwendet wird, sind die Ergebnisse in vielen Bereichen sehr {\"{a}}hnlich. Interessanterweise gibt es zwar l{\"{a}}nderspezifische Unterschiede zwischen Deutschland und der Schweiz, wird jedoch nur die Deutschschweiz in diesen L{\"{a}}ndervergleich miteinbezogen, so werden diese um einiges geringer. Die Deutschschweizer Jugendlichen sind ihren deutschen Nachbarn in bestimmten Bereichen also n{\"{a}}her als ihren Landesgenossen in der lateinischen Schweiz (z.B. in der aktiven Gestaltung von Content im Internet oder der Aktivierung von Privatsph{\"{a}}re-Einstellungen in Social Networks). Wie bereits erw{\"{a}}hnt k{\"{o}}nnen sprachkulturelle Gegebenheiten Ursache f{\"{u}}r diese Unterschiede sein, wobei die deutschschweizer Medien- Kultur der deutschen offensichtlich n{\"{a}}her ist als derjenigen der Romands und Tessiner. Zusammengefasst unterscheiden sich die beiden L{\"{a}}nder kaum in der Freizeitgestaltung, lediglich die Geschlechtsunterschiede sind in der Schweiz pr{\"{a}}gnanter. Das TV-Programm wird in Deutschland noch {\"{o}}fters {\"{u}}ber das Fernsehger{\"{a}}t rezipiert, die Schweizer schauen dagegen mehr TV-Sendungen {\"{u}}bers Internet. Ebenso werden Radio, B{\"{u}}cher und der Computer ohne Internetzugang in Deutschland h{\"{a}}ufiger genutzt. In der Schweiz haben drei von vier Jugendlichen einen eigenen Computer zur Verf{\"{u}}gung, das ist ein Viertel mehr als in Deutschland. Diese werden hierzulande f{\"{u}}r Schule oder Lehre h{\"{a}}ufiger eingesetzt. Die j{\"{u}}ngste Schweizer Altersgruppe nutzt denn auch den Computer und das Internet {\"{o}}fter zur Unterhaltung als ihre gleichaltrigen Nachbarn aus Deutschland. Den Zugang zu Informationen beschaffen sich deutsche und Schweizer Jugendliche sehr unterschiedlich. Ebenso unterscheiden sich die Pr{\"{a}}ferenzen von Social Networks zwischen den L{\"{a}}ndern, wie auch die Respektierung der Privatsph{\"{a}}re anderer, diese wird in der Schweiz eher gewahrt, es werden also weniger Fotos oder Videos von anderen Personen ohne deren Zustimmung ins Internet gestellt. Im Bereich der Videogames und der Handynutzung gibt es kaum l{\"{a}}nderspezifische Unterschiede. Insgesamt weisen die Befragten ein hohes Mass an Individualit{\"{a}}t und ein breites Spektrum an Interessen auf. Handlungsbedarf besteht bei der bewussteren Auswahl der Videogames nach PEGI-Kriterien, wobei hier insbesondere auch die erwachsenen Bezugspersonen zur Verantwortung gezogen werden m{\"{u}}ssen. Ebenso sollte der Umgang mit problematischen Inhalten auf dem Handy thematisiert werden, dies am besten in der Schule und zwar bereits auf Primarschulstufe. In Zeiten von WikiLeaks sind jegliche Informationen im World Wide Web potentiell zug{\"{a}}nglich. Jugendliche sollten hinreichend {\"{u}}ber die Konsequenzen von zu offenem Umgang mit privaten Informationen aufgekl{\"{a}}rt werden, dies gilt insbesondere f{\"{u}}r die J{\"{u}}ngsten, welche am wenigsten von der M{\"{o}}glichkeit Gebrauch machen, ihre Privatsph{\"{a}}re in Social Networks zu sch{\"{u}}tzen. Des Weiteren ist zu betonen, dass dieses Wissen, das sich die Digital Natives schon in ihren fr{\"{u}}hen Lebensjahren aneignen weiterhin gef{\"{o}}rdert werden soll. Unterst{\"{u}}tzt vom Allgemeinwissen ihrer erwachsenen Bezugspersonen, die ihnen die gesellschaftlichen, gesundheitlichen und moralischen Aspekte des Medienhandelns aufzeigen k{\"{o}}nnen und ihnen auch einen produktiven Umgang, selbstverantwortliches Handeln und die n{\"{o}}tige Abgrenzung vorleben sollten. Wie eingangs erw{\"{a}}hnt, verfolgen wir das Ziel, in der Schweiz ebenfalls},
