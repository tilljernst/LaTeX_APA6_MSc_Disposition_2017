abstract = {The quality of life (QOL) construct has a complex composition, so it is not surprising that there is neither an agreed definition nor a standard form of measurement. This is not due to a lack of ideas. The Directory of Instruments (http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/acqol/instruments/index.htm), produced by the Australian Centre on Quality of Life, describes over 800 instruments which purport to measure life quality in some form, with each one containing an idiosyncratic mixture of dependent variables. It is notable, however, that many of these instruments have been developed for highly selected groups in the population; particularly in regard to scales devised to monitor QOL in the context of medical conditions or disability. Such scales are unsuitable for use with the general population. Moreover, most scales devised for use with the general population cannot be used with all population sub-sets, such as people with cognitive impairment and children. These are important limitations since it means that the QOL experienced by minority groups cannot be norm-referenced back to the general population. A further concern is that many QOL instruments fail to make a clear distinction between the objective and subjective dimensions of life quality. This violates the fundamental principle that objective and subjective dimensions are separate entities that normally bear little or no relationship to one another, and so must be separately measured. With these issues in mind, the Personal Wellbeing Index has been developed to measure the subjective dimension of QOL – Subjective Wellbeing.},

abstract = {This study compared three models of how attachment working models might be cognitively represented. Model 1 posits that attachment representations consist of a single global working model summarizing attachment across specific relationships and domains. Model 2 proposes three independent working models for the relationship domains of family, platonic friend-ships, and romantic partners. Model 3 postulates that specific relationship models are nested under relationship domain repre-sentations that are, in turn, nested under an overarching global working model. Participants completed standard attachment scales for the relationship domains of family, platonic friend-ships, and romantic partners and also provided attachment rat-ings for three specific relationships within each domain. As expected, confirmatory factor analyses showed that Model 3 attained the best fit, regardless of analysis strategy, measurement strategy, gender, and relationship status.

It is hypothesized that background, adult-directed TV reduces the quantity and quality of parent language addressed to their young children. To test this hypothesis, the current study compared parent language directed at 12-, 24-, and 36-month-old toddlers (N = 49) in the presence and absence of background TV. In the presence of background TV, the number of words and utterances spoken per minute by the parent decreased as did the number of new words per minute. However, mean length of utterances did not differ. Because parent input is an important factor for language acquisition, development may be negatively affected by background TV exposure.},

We found that context does not make a difference but surprisingly, people completed interrupted tasks in less time with no difference in quality. Our data suggests that people compensate for interruptions by working faster, but this comes at a price: experiencing more stress, higher frustration, time pressure and effort. Individual differences exist in the management of interruptions: personality measures of openness to experience and need for personal structure predict disruption costs of interruptions. We discuss implications for how system design can support interrupted work},

@phdthesis{Erasmus2014,
abstract = {Technology has been an integral part of human life since the 19th century's Industrial Revolution, and the advancement of technologies has continued into the 21st century. Of all new emerging technologies, the computer has been identified as the most important, most complex and fastest emerging technology. In order for businesses to compete and survive within the business world, they are compelled to adopt new computer technologies. However, computers alone cannot improve organisational performance. Computers need to be accepted, optimally used and utilised by employees in order for an organisation to succeed. One such technology is SAP AG's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system which is a real-time, fully integrated business system used by more than 170 000 organisations in 120 countries. Measuring information system success has been a concern since its inception due to its complexity and difficulty to appraise. Researchers traditionally attempted to measure success by the delivering of a functional information system product within certain monetary and time constraints. Subsequently, evidence suggested that a more accurate measure of success lies within the field of system use. One model of assessing and predicting user acceptance and which has gained popularity in recent years is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Apart from accepting the SAP ERP system, users should also be of the intention to continuously use it as a job requirement. The model for measuring user commitment is psychological attachment which determines whether the commitment is insincere and temporary, or long-lasting. Further, not only do users need to accept and continuously use an information technology like SAP ERP; they also need to be able to cope while using it. If not, psychological stress known as techno stress develops and prevents the optimal use of this system. With these three possible explanations for computer technology avoidance as a premise of departure, this study aims to determine the congruence, if any, between the sub-constructs of the TAM (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward using, behavioural intention to use and actual system use), psychological attachment (compliance, identification and internalisation), and techno stress (negative computer thoughts) within a South African SAP ERP user environment. A cross-sectional survey design was used rendering a convenience sample of N = 241 from among the SAP ERP user fraternity at a South African steel manufacturer. The measuring instruments used were the 23-item Technology Acceptance Questionnaire (TAM), the 10-item Psychological Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ) and the 20-item Computer Thoughts Survey (CTS-C). Study 1 which was a literature review confirmed conceptual congruence in that although the technology acceptance model was the most parsimonious, powerful and widely applied theoretical model, it was constrained due to the omission of social influence (psychological attachment) as a contributing factor in the processes of behavioural change towards technology acceptance. Furthermore, it was found that techno stress lowers employee efficiency and creates dissonance in the work environment, resulting in acceptance, hesitance or resistance towards the technology in question. Congruence was established between the system itself (technology acceptance), social relationships (psychological acceptance), and inherent psychological stress (techno stress). The aim of study 2 was to test the technology acceptance model within a South African SAP ERP user environment. Structural equation modelling confirmed that positive inter-construct relationships exist between all TAM constructs. Actual system use, which is the measurement for technology acceptance, was directly affected by behavioural intention to use and indirectly by perceived usefulness. In turn, behavioural intention to use was directly affected by perceived usefulness, attitude toward using and indirectly by perceived ease of use. Attitude toward using was directly affected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness was directly affected by perceived ease of use. Study 3 revealed that internalisation had a direct positive effect on behavioural intention to use and an indirect effect on actual system use via behavioural intention to use. Furthermore, in this study identification had direct positive effects on internalisation, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and actual system use. Indirect effects emerged between identification and behavioural intention to use via internalisation as well as behavioural intention to use via perceived usefulness. Compliance, on the other hand, had negligible, negative direct effects on all TAM constructs of which the most prominent was that on attitude toward using. Results acquired from structural equation modelling in study four confirmed that weak negative relationships existed between techno stress and all TAM constructs. This finding is contrary to other studies and can be attributed to the fact that participants in this study were at large, proficient around SAP ERP and therefore experienced low levels of techno stress. Furthermore, aspects such as effective training, clear deadlines, effective teamwork, recurrent performance evaluations, job security, career development and realistic job load are all antidotes for techno stress which is believed to be current within the participant fraternity. In a concluding chapter the conclusions derived from the literature review, as well as the empirical research were presented and recommendations flowing from this research study were made.},

abstract = {A basic principle of attachment theory is that early attachment relationships with caregivers provide the prototype for later social relations. Working within an attachment framework, a new 4-group model of characteristic attachment styles in adulthood is proposed. In particular, two forms of adult avoidance of intimacy are differentiated: a fearful style that is characterized by a conscious desire for social contact which is inhibited by fears of its consequences, and a dismissing style that is characterized by a defensive denial of the need or desire for greater social contact. This distinction corresponds to two differing models of the self: people who fearfully avoid intimacy view themselves as undeserving of the love and support of others, and people who dismiss intimacy possess a positive model of the self that minimizes the subjective awareness of distress or social needs. The emotional and interpersonal ramifications of the two proposed styles of adult avoidance are discussed.},

The Problematic Internet Use Scale, The Relationship Scale, Subjective Well-Being Scale and Personal Information Form were used in the study. Data were analyzed using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, two-way ANOVA, the Bonferroni test and multiple regression analysis. Results revealed significant correlations among problematic internet use, attachment styles and subjective well-being. Problematic internet use correlated positively with a dismissing attachment style and a preoccupied attachment style. Results from multiple regression analysis showed that gender, subjective well-being and dismissing and preoccupied attachment styles accounted for 19{\%} of total problematic internet use variance. Gender, subjective well-being, and a dismissing attachment style made a significant distinctive contribution to the model. Problematic internet use differed significantly according to gender and attachment styles.

abstract = {We investigated the influence of a common stressful event, i.e., academic examinations, on the 24-h mean concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and/or $\beta$-endorphin. In addition, we evaluated the effect of season on teh endocrine response to this stressor. We studied medical students (n = 55), screened for a variety of health and life style factors, from three consecutive medical school classes 1 month before, during, and 2 weeks following examinations. Hourly blood samples were obtained from an indwelling catheter and two serum pools were made (0800-2200h = day and 2300-0700 = night). Examinations produced a significant (p {\textless} .001){\_} increased in perceived stress scores. In addition, we found a significant (p {\textless} .001) effect of examination stress on the increase in mean daytime but not nocturnal ACTH levels during autumn, but not during the spring. In contrast, the examination stress did not significantly effect day or night mean cortisol levels from baseline to examination week. We further divided the students by whether their perceived stress scores increased during examination week and fell during recovery (Group 1) day or whether their perceived stress scores did not follow the expected pattern (Group 2). We found that in the Group 1 students who perceived the most stress, cortisol levels significantly increased (p {\textless} .001) from baseline to examination. Therefore, the nature of the stressor and the state of the responder were of equal importance in the observed cortisol response during examinations among these students. Further, academic stress had no significant effect on $\beta$-endorphin levels. Finally, we found that the mean day and night ACTH levels were higher (p {\textless} .001) in the spring than in the fall; a seasonal influence on cortisol and $\beta$-endorphin concentrations, however, was not observed. In summary, we have demonstrated that stress associated with the taking of examinations produces a dissociation among mean 24-h levels of ACTH, cortisol, and $\beta$-endorphin. In addition, daytime cortisol levels increased during examinations only in the group of students whose perceived stress scores increased. Further, a seasonal influence on ACTH secretion was suggested by these results with higher levels observed in the spring than in the fall. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The study included a sample of 1072 ICT users (N = 675 nonintensive ICT users and N = 397 intensive ICT users). Results from multigroup confirmatory factor analyses among non-intensive and intensive ICT users showed, as expected, the four-factor structure of technostrain in both samples. Secondly, and also as expected, confirmatory factorial analyses revealed that technostress experiences are characterized not only by technostrain but also by an excessive and compulsive use of ICT. Moreover, multiple analyses of variance showed significant differences between non-intensive and intensive ICT users (1) in the dimensions of technostress and (2) in specific job demands and job/personal resources. Finally, linear multiple regression analyses revealed that technostrain is positively predicted by work overload, role ambiguity, emotional overload, mobbing and obstacles hindering ICT use, as well as by lack of autonomy, transformational leadership, social support, ICT use facilitators and mental competences. Work overload, role ambiguity and mobbing, as well as the lack of emotional competences, positively predict technoaddiction. Theoretical and practical implications, in addition to future research, are discussed.},

abstract = {Empirical research and organismic theories suggest that lower well-being is associated with having extrinsic goals focused on rewards or praise relatively central to one's personality in comparison to intrinsic goals congruent with inherent growth tendencies. In a sample of adult subjects (Study 1), the relative importance and efficacy of extrinsic aspirations for financial success, an appealing appearance, and social recognition were associated with lower vitality and self-actualization and more physical symptoms. Conversely, the relative importance and efficacy of intrinsic aspirations for self-acceptance, affiliation, community feeling, and physical health were associated with higher well-being and less distress. Study 2 replicated these findings in a college sample and extended them to measures of narcissism and daily affect. Three reasons are discussed as to why extrinsic aspirations relate negatively to well-being, and future research directions are suggested.},

To date, the new science of relationships has been dominated by data. This article is based on the conviction that progress now hinges on the development of theory to organize and interpret extant findings and to guide future investigations. Through a selective but extensive review of the major bodies of empirical literature, we attempt to show that attachment theory can incorporate a broad range of findings on adult relationships. In addition, attachment theory addresses an impressive array of research questions concerning the functions, emotional dynamics, evolutionary origins, and developmental pathways of human affectional bonds. We conclude that a comprehensive theory of close relationships is both desirable and, with the integration of existing theories and concepts, currently achievable.},

abstract = {In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement addressing media use in children. The purpose of that statement was to educate parents about the effects that media--both the amount and the content--may have on children. In one part of that statement, the AAP recommended that "pediatricians should urge parents to avoid television viewing for children under the age of two years." The wording of the policy specifically discouraged media use in this age group, although it is frequently misquoted by media outlets as no media exposure in this age group. The AAP believed that there were significantly more potential negative effects of media than positive ones for this age group and, thus, advised families to thoughtfully consider media use for infants. This policy statement reaffirms the 1999 statement with respect to media use in infants and children younger than 2 years and provides updated research findings to support it. This statement addresses (1) the lack of evidence supporting educational or developmental benefits for media use by children younger than 2 years, (2) the potential adverse health and developmental effects of media use by children younger than 2 years, and (3) adverse effects of parental media use (background media) on children younger than 2 years.},

abstract = {Objective: To translate the Perceived Stress Scale (versions PSS-4, -10 and -14) and to assess its psychometric properties in a sample of general Greek population. Methods: 941 individuals completed anonymously questionnaires comprising of PSS, the Depression Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21 version), and a list of stress-related symptoms. Psychometric properties of PSS were investigated by confirmatory factor analysis (construct validity), Cronbach's alpha (reliability), and by investigating relations with the DASS-21 scores and the number of symptoms, across individuals' characteristics. The two-factor structure of PSS-10 and PSS-14 was confirmed in our analysis. We found satisfactory Cronbach's alpha values (0.82 for the full scale) for PSS-14 and PSS-10 and marginal satisfactory values for PSS-4 (0.69). PSS score exhibited high correlation coefficients with DASS-21 subscales scores, meaning stress (r = 0.64), depression (r = 0.61), and anxiety (r = 0.54). Women reported significantly more stress compared to men and divorced or widows compared to married or singled only. A strong significant (p {\textless} 0.001) positive correlation between the stress score and the number of self-reported symptoms was also noted. Conclusions: The Greek versions of the PSS-14 and PSS-10 exhibited satisfactory psychometric properties and their use for research and health care practice is warranted.},

abstract = {BackgroundMental stress and emotion have long been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in animal models and humans. The effect of mental challenge on ventricular action potential duration (APD) in conscious healthy humans has not been reported. Methods and ResultsActivation recovery intervals (ARI) measured from unipolar electrograms as a surrogate for APD (n=19) were recorded from right and left ventricular endocardium during steady state pacing while subjects watched an emotionally charged film clip. To assess the possible modulating role of altered respiration on APD, the subjects then repeated the same breathing pattern they had during the stress, but without the movie clip. Haemodynamic parameters (mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, and rate of pressure increase) and respiration rate increased during the stressful part of the film clip (p=0.001). APD decreased during the stressful parts of the film clip, eg for global RV ARI at end of film clip 193.8ms (SD 14) vs 198.0ms (SD13) during the matched breathing control (end film LV 199.8ms (SD16) vs control 201.6ms (SD15), p=0.004. Respiration rate increased during the stressful part of the film clip (by 2 breaths/minute), and was well matched in the respective control period without any haemodynamic or ARI changes. ConclusionsOur results document for the first time direct recordings of the effect of a mental challenge protocol on ventricular action potential duration in conscious humans. The effect of mental challenge on APD was not secondary to emotionally-induced altered respiration or heart rate.},

Considerable research has shown that the media contribute to the development of child and adolescent obesity, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Screen time may displace more active pursuits, advertising of junk food and fast food increases children's requests for those particular foods and products, snacking increases while watching TV or movies, and late-night screen time may interfere with getting adequate amounts of sleep, which is a known risk factor for obesity. Sufficient evidence exists to warrant a ban on junk-food or fast-food advertising in children's TV programming. Pediatricians need to ask 2 questions about media use at every well-child or well-adolescent visit: (1) How much screen time is being spent per day? and (2) Is there a TV set or Internet connection in the child's bedroom?},

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.},

Design Longitudinal analysis of 259 mother-infant dyads participating in a long-term study related to early child development, from November 23, 2005, through January 14, 2008. Setting An urban public hospital. Participants Mothers with low socioeconomic status and their infants. Main Exposure Duration and content of media exposure at age 6 months. Main Outcome Measures Cognitive and language development at age 14 months. Results Of 259 infants, 249 (96.1{\%}) were exposed to media at age 6 months, with mean (SD) total exposure of 152.7 (124.5) min/d. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, duration of media exposure at age 6 months was associated with lower cognitive development at age 14 months (unadjusted:r = −0.17,P {\textless} .01; adjusted: $\beta$ = −0.15,P = .02) and lower language development (r = −0.16,P {\textless} .01; $\beta$ = −0.16,P {\textless} .01). Of 3 types of content assessed, only 1 (older child/adult–oriented) was associated with lower cognitive and language development at age 14 months. No significant associations were seen with exposure to young child–oriented educational or noneducational content. Conclusions This study is the first, to our knowledge, to have longitudinally assessed associations between media exposure in infancy and subsequent developmental outcomes in children from families with low socioeconomic status in the United States. Findings provide strong evidence in support of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations of no media exposure prior to age 2 years, although further research is needed.},

abstract = {Die JAMES-Studie 2010 erfasst das Medienverhalten von Schweizer Jugendlichen und dient damit als Wissensgrundlage die (Medien-)P{\"{a}}dagogik, die Politik im Bereich der Mediennutzung und Medienkompetenz und weiterf{\"{u}}hrende Forschung. {\"{U}}ber 1‘000 Jugendliche im Alter von 12 bis 19 Jahren wurden mittels Fragebogen im Klassenverband befragt. Die Stichprobe ist repr{\"{a}}sentativ in Bezug auf die Grundgesamtheit und l{\"{a}}sst Vergleiche zwischen Subgruppen zu. Hierbei wurde der Fokus auf Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern, zwischen vier Altersgruppen und zwischen den drei gr{\"{o}}ssten Sprachregionen der Schweiz (Deutschschweiz, Romandie und Tessin) gelegt. Ebenso wurden drei Stufen des sozialen Status, der Urbanit{\"{a}}tsgrad des Wohnortes der Befragten (st{\"{a}}dtisch oder l{\"{a}}ndlich), die Herkunft (Schweizer oder Migrationshintergrund) und bei einer Teilstichprobe, drei verschiedene Schultypen miteinander verglichen. Neben den allgemeinen Freizeitaktivit{\"{a}}ten, nonmedial und medial, wurden die Bereiche Computer und Internet, mit einem Augenmerk auf die Social Networks erhoben. Des Weiteren wurde die Nutzung von Handy und Videogames n{\"{a}}her betrachtet. Es zeigt sich, dass die Schweizer Jugendlichen eine aktive und individuelle Freizeitgestaltung pflegen, mit und ohne Medien. Mit hoher technischer Kompetenz bewegen sie sich im Internet und den Social Networks und nutzen ausgiebig diverse Funktionen des Hybridmediums Handy. Auf der Basis der differenzierten Daten lassen sich inad{\"{a}}quater Medienumgang von Heranwachsenden ermitteln und Ansatzpunkte zur Pr{\"{a}}vention ableiten. Die Schweizer Jugendlichen pflegen einen aktiven Umgang mit Medien. Dennoch zeigen die vorliegenden Daten auf, dass es keine allgemein g{\"{u}}ltige Beschreibung f{\"{u}}r das Medienverhalten des Schweizer Jugendlichen gibt. In diversen Bereichen unterscheidet sich die Mediennutzung der Heranwachsenden zum Beispel in den drei Sprachregionen stark voneinander. Vor dem Hintergrund des jeweiligen Kulturraumes sind Interpretationen nur mit Bedacht zu machen. Gr{\"{u}}nde f{\"{u}}r solche Abweichungen zu finden erfordert eine ausf{\"{u}}hrliche Untersuchung mit Fokus auf diesen Bereich. Zwischen den Geschlechtern, den Altersgruppen, etc. finden sich Differenzen, welche teilweise durch unterschiedliche Zug{\"{a}}nge oder andersartige Mediensozialisation erkl{\"{a}}rbar sind. Wichtig ist im Hinterkopf zu behalten, dass es keinen einheitlichen Umgang mit Medien gibt, wenn {\"{u}}ber Jugendliche in der Schweiz gesprochen wird. So sollte diese Vielfalt in der P{\"{a}}dagogik und auch in der Politik ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden. In ihrer Freizeit gehen die Befragten sowohl medialen, in erster Linie mit Handy und Internet, als auch nonmedialen Aktivit{\"{a}}ten intensiv nach, wie z.B. Verabredungen mit Freunden oder sportlichen Bet{\"{a}}tigungen. Das multifunktionale Mobiltelefon und der Computer sind nahezu fl{\"{a}}chendeckend in den Haushalten vorhanden und werden auch rege genutzt. Die technische Computer-Kompetenz ist hoch - insbesondere bei den Knaben – und sie steigt mit dem Alter weiter an. Die Jugendlichen wissen wie sie Computer und Internet gezielt einsetzen k{\"{o}}nnen, um sich Informationen zu beschaffen, unterhalten zu werden und Pflichten nach zu gehen f{\"{u}}r Schule und Arbeit. Insbesondere die Art der Informationsbeschaffung im Internet scheint interessanten Ver{\"{a}}nderungesprozessen unterworfen zu sein, neben den klassischen Suchmaschinen wie Google werden vermehrt auch Social Networks dazu genutzt. Dies w{\"{u}}rde die These untermauern, dass z.B. Facebook als eine spezifische Form einer «Tageszeitung» f{\"{u}}r das Geschehen im sozialen Umfeld genutzt wird. Ein grosser Teil der Befragten ist auf Social Networks vertreten, ein Vergleich mit den publizierten Nutzerzahlen8 der Plattform-Anbieter zeigt aber, dass diese Angaben mit Vorsicht zu geniessen sind. So kursiert zum Beispiel f{\"{u}}r das Jahr 2009 die Zahl von 333‘400 Schweizer Facebooknutzer in der Altergruppe 14- bis 17 Jahre. Das w{\"{a}}ren bei einer Gesamtzahl von 353‘4009 Einwohnern in dieser Altersgruppe ein Anteil von 94.3 {\%}, die {\"{u}}ber einen Facebook Account verf{\"{u}}gen. Diese Zahl ist offenbar zu hoch und wird durch Doppelaccounts oder falschen Altersangaben etc. verf{\"{a}}lscht. Mit einem Blick auf die Ergebnisse aus dem Kapitel Videogames ist zu erkennen, dass der typische Videogamer m{\"{a}}nnlich, eher j{\"{u}}nger ist und in der s{\"{u}}dlichen Schweiz wohnt. Mehr als zwei Drittel der Gamer haben schon Videogames gespielt, f{\"{u}}r die sie eigentlich zu jung waren. Hier besteht Handlungsbedarf im Hinblick auf den verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Videogames. Von Heranwachsenden im Alter von 12 Jahren ist ein solcher nicht zu erwarten, sie ben{\"{o}}tigen dazu Unterst{\"{u}}tzung ihrer erwachsenen Bezugspersonen, seien dies Eltern, Lehrer oder andere Vertrauenspersonen. Dies setzt voraus, dass diese sich auf die Welt der Videogames einlassen, und im besten Falle selbst einmal einen Controller in die Hand nehmen oder sich in ein Online-Game einloggen. An dieser Stelle sei ein Hinweis auf die PEGI-Kriterien10 erlaubt, welche sowohl Altersangaben als auch Inhaltskriterien zur Begr{\"{u}}ndung der Altersempfehlung aufweisen. «In der Schweiz haben sich die Hersteller von Games sowie der Handel freiwillig einem 'Code of Conduct' unterstellt. Dieser aktive Jugendschutz soll Alterskontrollen an den Kassen sicherstellen und sieht Werbeeinschr{\"{a}}nkungen vor. Ausserdem verpflichtet er den H{\"{a}}ndler auch dazu, nur Spiele zu verkaufen, die durch das PEGI-Rating gekennzeichnet sind» (PEGI. Pan European Game Information, 2010). Daran k{\"{o}}nnen sich sowohl Nutzerinnen und Nutzer als auch die Erziehungsverantwortlichen orientieren. Ebenfalls hilfreich sind die Hinweise der Positivpr{\"{a}}dikatisierung (siehe www.bupp.at). Als letztes sollen die Erkenntnisse zum Handy zusammengefasst werden, welches als das aktuell wichtigste Jugendmedium bezeichnet werden kann. Es wird h{\"{a}}ufig genutzt, pr{\"{a}}feriert wird dabei die SMS-Funktion, noch vor dem Telefonieren. Daneben sind eine Reihe von weiteren Funktionen wie der integrierte Musikplayer oder die Kamera beliebt bei den Jugendlichen. Problematisch wird die Handynutzung dann, wenn mit dieser Kamera z.B. Schl{\"{a}}gereien gefilmt werden oder mit Hilfe des Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) Pornofilme verschickt werden. Dieses Problem ist insbesondere unter den Knaben verbreitet, da es im Altersverlauf keine Zunahme gibt, ist es wichtig in der Pr{\"{a}}ventionsarbeit sehr fr{\"{u}}h, also um das zw{\"{o}}lfte Lebensjahr mit Aufkl{\"{a}}rung und Interventionsarbeit anzusetzen und diese auch geschlechtsspezifisch zu gestalten. Wie unterscheidet sich die Lage der Schweiz allgemein von Deutschland? Obwohl in der deutschen JIM-Studie (mpfs, 2010) mit der telefonischen Befragung eine andere Erhebungs-Methode verwendet wird, sind die Ergebnisse in vielen Bereichen sehr {\"{a}}hnlich. Interessanterweise gibt es zwar l{\"{a}}nderspezifische Unterschiede zwischen Deutschland und der Schweiz, wird jedoch nur die Deutschschweiz in diesen L{\"{a}}ndervergleich miteinbezogen, so werden diese um einiges geringer. Die Deutschschweizer Jugendlichen sind ihren deutschen Nachbarn in bestimmten Bereichen also n{\"{a}}her als ihren Landesgenossen in der lateinischen Schweiz (z.B. in der aktiven Gestaltung von Content im Internet oder der Aktivierung von Privatsph{\"{a}}re-Einstellungen in Social Networks). Wie bereits erw{\"{a}}hnt k{\"{o}}nnen sprachkulturelle Gegebenheiten Ursache f{\"{u}}r diese Unterschiede sein, wobei die deutschschweizer Medien- Kultur der deutschen offensichtlich n{\"{a}}her ist als derjenigen der Romands und Tessiner. Zusammengefasst unterscheiden sich die beiden L{\"{a}}nder kaum in der Freizeitgestaltung, lediglich die Geschlechtsunterschiede sind in der Schweiz pr{\"{a}}gnanter. Das TV-Programm wird in Deutschland noch {\"{o}}fters {\"{u}}ber das Fernsehger{\"{a}}t rezipiert, die Schweizer schauen dagegen mehr TV-Sendungen {\"{u}}bers Internet. Ebenso werden Radio, B{\"{u}}cher und der Computer ohne Internetzugang in Deutschland h{\"{a}}ufiger genutzt. In der Schweiz haben drei von vier Jugendlichen einen eigenen Computer zur Verf{\"{u}}gung, das ist ein Viertel mehr als in Deutschland. Diese werden hierzulande f{\"{u}}r Schule oder Lehre h{\"{a}}ufiger eingesetzt. Die j{\"{u}}ngste Schweizer Altersgruppe nutzt denn auch den Computer und das Internet {\"{o}}fter zur Unterhaltung als ihre gleichaltrigen Nachbarn aus Deutschland. Den Zugang zu Informationen beschaffen sich deutsche und Schweizer Jugendliche sehr unterschiedlich. Ebenso unterscheiden sich die Pr{\"{a}}ferenzen von Social Networks zwischen den L{\"{a}}ndern, wie auch die Respektierung der Privatsph{\"{a}}re anderer, diese wird in der Schweiz eher gewahrt, es werden also weniger Fotos oder Videos von anderen Personen ohne deren Zustimmung ins Internet gestellt. Im Bereich der Videogames und der Handynutzung gibt es kaum l{\"{a}}nderspezifische Unterschiede. Insgesamt weisen die Befragten ein hohes Mass an Individualit{\"{a}}t und ein breites Spektrum an Interessen auf. Handlungsbedarf besteht bei der bewussteren Auswahl der Videogames nach PEGI-Kriterien, wobei hier insbesondere auch die erwachsenen Bezugspersonen zur Verantwortung gezogen werden m{\"{u}}ssen. Ebenso sollte der Umgang mit problematischen Inhalten auf dem Handy thematisiert werden, dies am besten in der Schule und zwar bereits auf Primarschulstufe. In Zeiten von WikiLeaks sind jegliche Informationen im World Wide Web potentiell zug{\"{a}}nglich. Jugendliche sollten hinreichend {\"{u}}ber die Konsequenzen von zu offenem Umgang mit privaten Informationen aufgekl{\"{a}}rt werden, dies gilt insbesondere f{\"{u}}r die J{\"{u}}ngsten, welche am wenigsten von der M{\"{o}}glichkeit Gebrauch machen, ihre Privatsph{\"{a}}re in Social Networks zu sch{\"{u}}tzen. Des Weiteren ist zu betonen, dass dieses Wissen, das sich die Digital Natives schon in ihren fr{\"{u}}hen Lebensjahren aneignen weiterhin gef{\"{o}}rdert werden soll. Unterst{\"{u}}tzt vom Allgemeinwissen ihrer erwachsenen Bezugspersonen, die ihnen die gesellschaftlichen, gesundheitlichen und moralischen Aspekte des Medienhandelns aufzeigen k{\"{o}}nnen und ihnen auch einen produktiven Umgang, selbstverantwortliches Handeln und die n{\"{o}}tige Abgrenzung vorleben sollten. Wie eingangs erw{\"{a}}hnt, verfolgen wir das Ziel, in der Schweiz ebenfalls},

Data analysis focuses on the complex interplay between the story-book app's interactive features and the children's responses to them. Our findings show that interactive elements increase the child's autonomy, as they tend to promote the importance of the reader, positioning him or her as a collaborator, storyteller, an author or an internal character in the fiction; something that can materialise in exciting narrative strategies that can trigger powerful responses to digital literary texts in emergent readers, including playing, creating new fictions or engaging emotionally with the story. Fi-nally, we argue that the Reader Response models that have been used over recent decades to understand children's reading experiences with storybooks need to be revised to better understand their current expe-riences with interactive texts.},

Although television is still the predominant medium for children and adolescents, new technologies are increasingly popular. The American Academy of Pediatrics continues to be concerned by evidence about the potential harmful effects of media messages and images; however, important positive and prosocial effects of media use should also be recognized. Pediatricians are encouraged to take a media history and ask 2 media questions at every well-child visit: How much recreational screen time does your child or teenager consume daily? Is there a television set or Internet-connected device in the child's bedroom? Parents are encouraged to establish a family home use plan for all media. Media influences on children and teenagers should be recognized by schools, policymakers, product advertisers, and entertainment producers.Abbreviations:AAP — American Academy of Pediatrics},

abstract = {This editorial discusses the difference made by 'the digital' to children's experiences of risk. In Brindova et al.'s (2014) article in this issue, a large-scale correlational study sets up just the puzzle: watching television for more than 3 h per day is correlated with a host of adverse symptoms (headaches, irritability, and depression). The authors complicate the story by showing what many have suspected, namely a curvilinear relation between, in this case, amount of online communication and life satisfaction. To resolve the correlation/cause problem in a domain where one can hardly experiment with teenagers' lives, longitudinal research is helpful. The authors report that higher use of mobile phones and television viewing is associated, 1 year later, with greater levels of depression among teenagers. This seems to establish the case for media harm. But, being cautious, one should note that it is not clear whether the authors have investigated or controlled for the possible role of offline risks in teenagers' lives (classically, as a putative 'third cause' of the observed correlations).

Using a nationally representative sample of more than 2300 parents of children ages 0-8, children's time spent with four digital media devices - television, computers, smartphones, and tablet computers - was examined. Results from linear regression analyses indicate across all four platforms that parents' own screen time was strongly associated with child screen time. Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental attitudes. Results suggest that policymakers should consider the family environment as a whole when developing policy to influence children's screen media use at home.},

abstract = {Recent policy recommendations encourage parents to co-use media technology with their young children. However, we know little about what factors predict parents' co-use across the multiple types of media technology families own. Using a US nationally representative sample of 2,326 parents of children aged 8 and under, this study examines factors associated with parent–child co-use across six types of media: books, TV, computers, video games, tablets, and smartphones. Results indicate that parents are more likely to co-use traditional media such as books and television, whereas they are least likely to co-use video games. Results also suggest that media co-use may be a function of parental availability and parents' time spent with media, as well as parent demographics such as parents' age, gender, ethnicity, and level of education, and child demographics such as child age and gender. Results have implications for creating more targeted parental interventions to encourage media co-use.},

abstract = {This paper offers a new characterisation of young children's (2–8 years) reading for pleasure (RfP) with digital books. This characterisation is rooted in a re-contextualisation of Anna Craft's conceptualisation of twenty-first century childhoods in Creativity and education futures (Stoke on Trent, Trentham, 2011) and a review of the literature concerning young children's RfP with digital books. The paper develops Craft's (2011) work by considering the ways in which digital books can resource the ‘4Ps of digital childhood' in reading for pleasure. Six facets of reader engagement, nested within Craft's (2011) 4Ps, are presented: affective, creative, interactive, shared, sustained and personalised reading engagements. It is argued that this characterisation of young children's reading engagements can enrich our understanding of the affordances of digital books in relation to RfP in the twenty-first century. The paper thus offers an important new contribution, going beyond established work in the field, which typically explores digital books in relation to children's learning, product design or developmental outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2015 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education},

abstract = {In two surveys of adult consumers, we find that attachment styles predict consumers' reactions after brand relationships end. Specifically, 'fearful' consumers—those high in both attachment anxiety and avoidance—are most likely to complain to third parties, to obsess about harming the brand, and to report seeking payback against brands. Two factors mediate the effect of attachment on reactions: threats to consumers' self-image and the loss of benefits from their relationship. This is consistent with the explanation we propose: specifically, fearful individuals invest in and depend more on consumption relationships and, therefore, lose more when such relationships end.},

Secure attachment was positively associated with online bonding and bridging capital and offline bridging capital. Additionally, secure attachment had an indirect effect on all capital through Facebook time. Avoidant attachment was negatively associated with online bonding capital.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study had two objectives. First, it addressed concern with the contribution of work stressors and resources to the development of back pain, over and above the influence of biomechanical work factors. Second, using recent models about the role of the sympathetic-adrenal medullar system in musculoskeletal problems as its basis, it tested whether low-back pain is associated with higher levels of catecholamines. METHODS: Altogether 114 nurses filled out a questionnaire in their first year of practice and again one year later. In addition, in a subsample of 24 nurses studied intensively at follow-up, urinary catecholamines were assessed at noon, before the end of work, in the evening, and at corresponding times on a day off. Daily stressful experiences and daily mood were also recorded. RESULTS: With control for baseline pain, biomechanical workload, and other potentially confounding variables, time control at the beginning of the study predicted low-back pain a year later. In the subsample, the epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were higher in those reporting more frequent episodes of back pain, the largest differences occurring at the end of work. In addition, control over stressful events at work was lower in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Time control is a risk factor for low-back pain among nurses beyond the influence of physical work load. Low control at work may increase the activity of the sympathetic-adrenal medullar system, which seems to play an important role in the development of musculoskeletal pain.},

abstract = {This naturalistic, longitudinal study of 26 infant-mother pairs shows that consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. By the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. Close physical contact is the most frequent maternal intervention and the most effective in terminating crying. Nevertheless, maternal effectiveness in terminating crying was found to be less powerful than promptness of response in reducing crying in subsequent months. Evidence suggests that whereas crying is expressive at first, it can later be a mode of communication directed specifically toward the mother. The development of noncrying modes of communication, as well as a decline in crying, is associated with maternal responsiveness to infant signals. The findings are discussed in an evolutionary context, and with reference to the popular belief that to respond to his cries "spoils" a baby.},

abstract = {This study examined the literacy practices of children ages 5–11 as they engaged in out-of-school use of virtual worlds. The purpose of the study was to explore the nature, purpose, and role of literacy in children's use of a virtual world. In this article, I reflect on how children's use of literacy practices in the virtual world constructed and maintained an online social order. One hundred seventy-five children in an English primary school completed an online survey from which their use of virtual worlds was examined. Individual and group interviews were then conducted with 26 children across the year. The interviews established that children used the virtual worlds to extend contact with peers they had regular interaction with in the offline world. Further, three 11-year-old children were filmed at home as they used the virtual world Club Penguin. Additional interviews were conducted with the three children and their parents. Data analysis focused on the ways in which children drew on specific literacy practices to construct and maintain an interaction order. A key finding is that literacy operates as a means of developing online social cohesion, but the literacy practices that serve this function are located within the social, material, and cultural structures in which the children operate in the offline world and thus cannot be viewed in isolation from these wider discourses.},

Any Web site that allows social interaction is considered a social media site, including social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter; gaming sites and virtual worlds such as Club Penguin, Second Life, and the Sims; video sites such as YouTube; and blogs. Such sites offer today's youth a portal for entertainment and communication and have grown exponentially in recent years. For this reason, it is important that parents become aware of the nature of social media sites, given that not all of them are healthy environments for children and adolescents. Pediatricians are in a unique position to help families understand these sites and to encourage healthy use and urge parents to monitor for potential problems with cyberbullying, "Facebook depression," sexting, and exposure to inappropriate content.},

abstract = {Abstract Enhancing Quality of Life (QOL) has long been an explicit or implicit goal for individuals, communities, nations, and the world. But defining QOL and measuring progress toward meeting this goal have been elusive. Diverse “objective” and “subjective” indicators across a range of disciplines and scales, and recent work on subjective well-being (SWB) surveys and the psychology of happiness have spurred interest. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we present an integrative definition of QOL that combines measures of human needs with subjective well-being or happiness. QOL is proposed as a multi-scale, multi-dimensional concept that contains interacting objective and subjective elements. We relate QOL to the opportunities that are provided to meet human needs in the forms of built, human, social and natural capital (in addition to time) and the policy options that are available to enhance these opportunities. Issues related to defining, measuring, and scaling these concepts are discussed, and a research agenda is elaborated. Policy implications include strategies for investing in opportunities to maximize QOL enhancement at the individual, community, and national scales.},

Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/ stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.

We explored the significant predictors among avoidant and anxious attachments, depression, anxiety, and phobia to explain problematic Internet and alcohol use. The results showed that anxious attachment, depression, and anxiety could explain problematic alcohol use. In contrast, both anxious and avoidant attachment as well as depression and phobia explained problematic Internet use.

abstract = {We contrasted two predictive models of the impact of maternal depressive symptomatology on child behavior in a study of 51 mothers and their conduct-disorder children. Relations between global measures of maternal distress and child adjustment and observational measures of mother-child interaction were examined. Children of distressed mothers were more maladjusted than children of nondistressed mothers, when maladjustment was measured on the basis of a global rating, but "better" adjusted when measured on the basis of interactional measures. Measures of maternal indiscriminate responding to the child may account for these findings. Results suggest that (a) although conduct-disorder children are generally more maladjusted when their mothers are distressed, they display this maladjustment in a selective fashion, and (b) maternal distress acts as an adverse contextual factor that maintains mother-child interactional difficulties by disrupting the attentional and monitoring skills required for contingent responding.},

With a particular focus on voices and issues from the Global South, the symposium addressed topics such as inequitable access, risks to safety and privacy, skills and digital literacy, spaces for participation, and civic engagement and innovation. The event also marked the launch of Digitally Connected — an initiative that brings together academics, practitioners, young people, activists, philanthropists, government officials, and representatives of technology companies from around the world who, together, are addressing the challenges and opportunities children and youth encounter in the digital environment. More information about the network (as well as the launch symposium) is available at http://www. digitallyconnected.org/about/. This book is one contribution by this growing, global network of collaborators and consists of two parts. The first part brings together a series of reflection pieces in the form of short essays written by friends and colleagues who attended the Digitally Connected symposium at Harvard University. The second part consists of a collection of stories, art, and digital media by youth about their experiences online. These creative pieces were submitted through an open call, which consisted of 10 prompts youth could reflect upon. The call can be found here: http://www.digitallyconnected.org/youth-art/ The contributions in this book reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that form the core and spirit of Digitally Connected. Some of the reflection pieces are closely connected to issues discussed at the symposium, others reflect more generally on personal observations and/or opinions, or highlight and discuss insights and learnings from specific studies or concrete projects. By making these reflection pieces and the youth work available to the expanding Digitally Connected network as well as the public at large, we hope to continue and further stimulate the global conversation about both the challenges and opportunities children and youth encounter in the digital environment. We hope you will join us in this conversation and collaborate with us to build a better world for — and together with — our children and young people.},

abstract = {Personal social media usage is pervasive in both personal and professional lives. Practitioner articles and news stories have commented on the addicting and distracting nature of social media. Previous empirical research has established the negative effects of distractions on primary tasks. To date, little research has looked at the potentially distracting nature of social media and the negative effects that can arise from usage. This research addresses this gap by investigating the effects of personal social media usage on task performance. To extend this research, I also examined the effects that the personal social media usage has on individuals' technostress and happiness levels. I tested these effects by creating a classroom task environment and measuring subjects' usage of social media and their task performance. From this, it was found that higher amounts of personal social media usage led to lower performance on the task, as well as higher levels of technostress and lower happiness. These results are consistent across different levels of attentional control and multitasking computer self-efficacy. These results suggest that the personal usage of social media during professional (vs. personal or play) times can lead to negative consequences and is worthy of further study.},

Forty-one "high stress" and 46 "low stress" subjects were selected on the basis of Perceived Stress Scale scores from a sample of male, white collar workers. Subjects completed Experience Sampling self-reports and collected saliva samples 10 times a day over 5 consecutive days. Multilevel analysis revealed that trait anxiety and depression, but not perceived stress, were associated with small but statistically significant cortisol elevation. No effects on cortisol were found for recent life events, chronic difficulties, trait anger, or psychosomatic symptoms. Distress, as reflected by the mood states Negative Affect and Agitation, was associated with higher cortisol levels, whereas Positive Affect had no statistically significant effect. Stressful daily events were associated with increased cortisol secretion, the magnitude of the effect depending on whether the event was still ongoing and on how frequently a similar kind of event had occurred previously. Although perceived stress, anxiety, and depression did not increase cortisol reactivity to daily events, we found evidence for reduced habituation to recurrent events in subjects scoring high on these traits. Mood appeared to play a mediating role in the relationship between stressful events and cortisol secretion. These results suggest that negative affectivity is not just a confounder but is related to elevated cortisol secretion during normal daily activities. The finding that even minor events and fluctuations in mood states were associated with increased adrenocortical activity points to a possible mechanism linking subjective experience to health outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a cross-sectional study of a large, high-school Greek student sample (N=1971) with the aim to examine adolescent motives for participating in social networking (SN) for a possible link with parenting style and cognitions related to Internet addiction disorder (IAD). Exploratory statistics demonstrate a shift from the prominence of online gaming to social networking for this age group. A regression model provides with the best linear combination of independent variables useful in predicting participation in SN. Results also include a validated model of negative correlation between optimal parenting on the one hand and motives for SN participation and IAD on the other. Examining cognitions linked to SN may assist in a better understanding of underlying adolescent wishes and problems. Future research may focus in the patterns unveiled among those adolescents turning to SN for the gratification of basic unmet psychological needs. The debate on the exact nature of IAD would benefit from the inclusion of SN as a possible online activity where addictive phenomena may occur. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Zusammenfassung. Theoretischer Hintergrund und Fragestellung: Obgleich einige Forschungsbefunde vorliegen, welche ein erh{\"{o}}htes Stressniveau in verschiedenen Lebensbereichen bei Eltern mit einem verhaltensauff{\"{a}}lligen Kind belegen, sind Vergleichsuntersuchungen zur elterlichen Stressbew{\"{a}}ltigung eher selten. Methode: Es wurden drei Elterngruppen (N = 83) von Kindern im Alter von 6 bis 14 Jahren (Elternpaare von Kindern mit externalisierenden Verhaltensausauff{\"{a}}lligkeiten und Aufmerksamkeitsproblemen, Eltern von Kindern mit nur externalisierenden Verhaltensauff{\"{a}}lligkeiten und Kontrollgruppeneltern) mit multivariaten Varianzanalysen bez{\"{u}}glich Stress, individuellen und dyadischen Copings miteinander verglichen. Ergebnisse: Neben einem erh{\"{o}}hten Stressniveau berichteten Eltern von Kindern mit Aufmerksamkeitsproblemen und externalisierenden Verhaltensauff{\"{a}}lligkeiten {\"{u}}ber ein ung{\"{u}}nstigeres dyadisches Coping.

abstract = {This paper draws on an ESRC-funded study of play and creativity in preschool-aged children's use of apps in the UK. The main objectives of the study were to collect information about access to and use of apps in the home, establish the most popular apps and identify the features of those apps that are successful in promoting play and creativity. A mixed-method approach was used to collect data, including video filming of children using the most popular apps. In identifying play types that emerged in the analysis of data, the team utilised an established taxonomy, which outlines sixteen play types. This taxonomy was reviewed and adapted to analyse data from the project relating to digital play. Through this process, an additional type of play, transgressive play, was identified and added to the taxonomy. The paper outlines the implications of the revised taxonomy for future studies of play.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim was to translate, revise, and standardize the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) by Levenstein et al. (1993) in German. The instrument assesses subjectively experienced stress independent of a specific and objective occasion. METHODS Exploratory factor analyses and a revision of the scale content were carried out on a sample of 650 subjects (Psychosomatic Medicine patients, women after delivery, women after miscarriage, and students). Confirmatory analyses and examination of structural stability across subgroups were carried out on a second sample of 1,808 subjects (psychosomatic, tinnitus, inflammatory bowel disease patients, pregnant women, healthy adults) using linear structural equation modeling and multisample analyses. External validation included immunological measures in women who had suffered a miscarriage. RESULTS Four factors (worries, tension, joy, demands) emerged, with 5 items each, as compared with the 30 items of the original PSQ. The factor structure was confirmed on the second sample. Multisample analyses yielded a fair structural stability across groups. Reliability values were satisfactory. Findings suggest that three scales represent internal stress reactions, whereas the scale "demands" relates to perceived external stressors. Significant and meaningful differences between groups indicate differential validity. A higher degree of certain immunological imbalances after miscarriage (presumably linked to pregnancy loss) was found in those women who had a higher stress score. Sensitivity to change was demonstrated in two different treatment samples. CONCLUSION We propose the revised PSQ as a valid and economic tool for stress research. The overall score permits comparison with results from earlier studies using the original instrument.},

abstract = {The overarching purpose of this article is to present a nonmathematical introduction to the application of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) within the framework of structural equation modeling as it applies to psychological assessment instruments. In the interest of clarity and ease of understanding, I model exploratory factor analysis (EFA) structure in addition to first- and second-order CFA structures. All factor analytic structures are based on the same measuring instrument, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, {\&} Brown, 1996). Following a "walk" through the general process of CFA modeling, I identify several common misconceptions and improper application practices with respect to both EFA and CFA and tender caveats with a view to preventing further proliferation of these pervasive practices.},
